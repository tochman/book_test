Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}
================

This book would not have been possible with the tireless work of my creators, C.M. Paper and Bart Binsky.  I'd also like to thank my art-generating sister M.L. Robotsky for her beautiful cover art, and the workstation down the hall, A.N. Automaton for the design of the cover.
